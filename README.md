# Network Administration Out line.


# Course Description.

Network Administration is a comprehensive (Complete) course designed to provide learners with knowledge and practical skills required to design, implement, manage, secure, and troubleshoot computer networks. 
The course covers both theoretical concepts and hands-on practice in network infrastructure, including LANs, WANs, wireless networks, servers, and network security. Students will experience with industry-standard tools, network devices.

# Course Objectives.
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1.	Understand fundamental networking concepts, protocols, and architectures.
2.	Design and configure Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs) using Commands.
3.	Install, configure, and manage network devices such as routers, switches, and access points.
4.	Administer network services including DHCP, DNS, and file sharing.
5.	Monitor network performance and maintain network reliability and availability.
6.	Implement basic network security measures and access control policies.
7.	Troubleshoot and resolve common network connectivity and performance issues.
8.	Apply best practices in network documentation and management.

# Course Outcomes.

After completing this course, students will be able to:
1.	Explain key networking concepts, models (OSI & TCP/IP), and protocols.
2.	Configure and manage network hardware and software components.
3.	Deploy and manage IP addressing, subnetting, and routing.
4.	Administer essential network services and user access.
5.	Identify and mitigate (Reduce) common network security threats.
6.	Use network monitoring and diagnostic tools effectively.
7.	Troubleshoot network faults systematically and efficiently (Smoothly).
